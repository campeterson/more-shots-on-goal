## Question:

> If you have an iPad without GPS (wifi-only), can you use your Garmin Aviator watch as a source of GPS location data?

## Answer:

> Yes, butâ€¦
> The watch works as a GPS source for Garmin Pilot and Garmin Explore apps. The watch does not act as a generic location provider in the same way that the Garmin GLO does. With my Garmin GLO, I can use my wifi-only iPad with any flying or tracking app and the position data is good. But it seems the Garmin aviator watches communicate different data and the Garmin Pilot and Garmin Explore apps know how to use it.
